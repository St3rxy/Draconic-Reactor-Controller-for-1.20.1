This is the code for CC: Tweaked mod (dont know where else it can work) for Draconic Reactor from Draconic Evolution mod.

There may be bugs and I don't know how to fix them, but it works well enough for me.

This is just a corrected version of the code for the reactor for newer versions of the Draconic Evolution mod. I don't know if it will work on versions earlier than 1.20.1 because I haven't tested it there and I modified the code for this version.

The code has been modified using AI because I don't know how to program, but I wanted to make this code work for this version.

All credit goes to the creators of the original code.
