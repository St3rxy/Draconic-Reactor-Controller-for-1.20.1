This is the code for CC: Tweaked mod (dont know where else it can work) for Draconic Reactor from Draconic Evolution mod.

There may be bugs and I don't know how to fix them, but it works well enough for me.

This is just a corrected version of the code for the reactor for newer versions of the Draconic Evolution mod. I don't know if it will work on versions earlier than 1.20.1 because I haven't tested it there and I modified the code for this version.

The code has been modified using AI because I don't know how to program, but I wanted to make this code work for this version. 

There could be finctions that are lost because of the AI.

All credit goes to the creator of the original code.

The the setup is on the original creators site.
